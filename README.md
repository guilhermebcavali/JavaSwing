## Overview
This project is a comprehensive case study of the **JavaSpring Framework** used for creating graphical user interfaces, implementing the **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** architectural pattern. Through this initiative, I enhanced my understanding of the separation of responsibilities among different components and the interaction between them.

## Key Learnings
- **Separation of Responsibilities:** Gained a deeper insight into dividing the system into distinct sections, each with its own role.
- **Advanced Java Features:** Enhanced my skills in utilizing Java's functions, lambda expressions, interfaces, and collections effectively.
